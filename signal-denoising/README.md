# Signal denoising practice with python

First I have read denoised wav file. 

Then I have implemented funcitons for moving average filter, median filter,
convolution and mse calculation. These functions are written by hand libraries are not used.

I applied some operations and filters on noisy signal.

When I applied moving average filter, I got 29536.65 MSE however I got 28530.7 MSE when Iapplied median filter on noisy signal.

I create denoised wav file at the end.
